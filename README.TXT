Hi! This was my final submission for FIT1056 at Monash University, which was completed in 2022 semester 2.
I ended up getting a perfect score for this submission, and got the highest in the cohort for this unit. I thoroughly enjoyed this unit and it was a pleasure working with javascript and bootstrap.
This unit is what got me into software engineering.
